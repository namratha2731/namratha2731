### Additional Notes for Visual and Statistical Analysis:

To incorporate a "visual and statistical analysis of contributions" and "logos," you would typically need:

* **Contribution Data**: This involves fetching data from platforms like GitHub API (e.g., number of commits, pull requests, issues opened/closed, lines of code changed over time). This data can then be processed and visualized using tools or libraries that generate charts/graphs (e.g., pie charts for language breakdown, bar charts for activity over time).
* **Language Logos**: Image files (PNG, SVG) of the respective language logos. These can be inserted into the README using markdown image syntax.

Since I operate within the confines of the provided files, I do not have direct access to your live GitHub contributions or external image assets for logos. You would need to manually obtain this data and these images to enhance this README further.
